## TODO

  - [ ] OpenAI Whisper integration
    - [ ] Add logic to be alerted of a new podcast post (likely from RSS feed)
  - [ ] Host on Google Cloud
  - [x] Remove duplicate posts
  - [ ] Increase model accuracy
    - [ ] Look into a case-_insensitve_ model that does not rely on capitalization (this is bottlenecked by Whisper)
    - [x] "Capitalization normalization" did not work
  - [ ] Categorizing recommendations
    - [ ] Add genre information to each book
    - [ ] Create running lists of reccomended books. This will include a "reccomended_in" with each podcast it was mentioned
